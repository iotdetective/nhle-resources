# New Hampshire Search Warrant Templates
Welcome, you have reached my public repository of search warrant templates for use by New Hampshire Law Enforcement Officers and Investigators. All templates have been stripped of case relevant facts and identifying data, they will help guide you with the follow examples:
- Vehicle Search Warrants
- Residential Search Warrants
- Meta Platforms (Facebook and Instagram) Search Warrants
- Snapchat Search Warrants
- Verizon Wireless Search Warrants
- T-Mobile Search Warrants
- Others
The repository is broken down into folders depending on the records sought or items to be seized.  There is also a repository of sample motions to seal, non-disclosure orders, search warrant attachments, etc.  I have created a Wiki page for this repository, which should help those of you who are new to Github [here](https://github.com/iotdetective/nhsw-templates/wiki).
